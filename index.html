    <p> I was born in Brooklyn, NY on November 25, 2003 to Werner and Emily Tsin.
        <br> I am the eldest daughter of four children. I enjoy going to the mall, watching movies and talking with my two younger sisters and younger brother.
        <br> My main hobbies include baking and nail art.
        <br> My favorite things to bake are cinnamon rolls and chocolate chip cookies. </p>
